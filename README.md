# Scenarios
- As a company, I need some new workers so I posted new job positions. I put a description and listed all requirements for the new position. 
  - I have received several requests from people who have applied for my posted job. I have looked at all the requests and some of them are suitable for this position and some are not. I reject those who don't fit this position and approve those who fit, into the next step (interviews, etc.)
  - While reviewing the request I take a look at the candidate's history to see if he/she did an internship in our company or attend our courses. This will help a lot to evaluate this candidate.
- As a company, I want to start an internship program for students so I posted new internship positions. I put descriptions and requirements.
  - A lot of students applied to my internship program but we can get only 5 of them so, I started reviewing CVs. I do not want to spend time reviewing students who are on the blacklist or blocked and because of that I just filter them out.
  - I contact the person to verify his request and to invite him to interview. I put some notes from our conversation so that next time I can see what we had talked about.
  - I called several times on his/her phone, but he/she did not respond. Sent an email but still did not get any response from him/her. I put some notes, so that in the future I can take a look at these notes and I will not spend too much time with this guy, and rejected the request.
  - I already approved 5 students for the internship program. Also, I have a few good students and I do not have any positions for them right now but I would like to have them next time. I put them in the reserve so that next time I will priority for them if they apply.
  - I'm reviewing the student's request and looking at his/her history to make sure this is a good candidate to approve for the next step.
